# Welcome to the Ren Community Graphics Repo!
This is a repo of graphics for Ren's Community Use. Below is a brief guide on how to download assets and contribute to the repo. Any questions or comments can be directed to our Community channels on Telgram / Discord. 

# Downloading Assets
When navigated to this repo you should see one folder Ren Graphics. Inside of that folder will be various subfolders labeled based on their contents, and some of those folders have subfolders with graphic variations of as asset (black Ren logo vs white Ren logo). 

In order to download one asset [(i.e. ren_logo_black.png)](https://github.com/terrafirmatrekker/Ren-Community-Graphics/blob/main/Ren%20Graphics/Ren_Logo/Black/ren%20logo%20black.png) simply navigate to the folder with the asset, click on the asset, and you should see it on your screen (some design files i.e .ai, .psd, .fig will not have a preview). Once on the screen you just need to right click the asset and choose the **Save Image As option.** If the asset is one of the design files without a preview just press the download button on the right side and the file will be downloaded to your Downloads folder on your computer. 

In order to download the entire repo from the repo's frontpage [i.e Ren-Community-Graphics]( https://github.com/terrafirmatrekker/Ren-Community-Graphics). Press the green code button on the repo's frontpage and choose **Download ZIP** While this is a quick and easy way to download the repo, it will also stress the Repo’s bandwidth limitations. Preferably, you will use the other method above by simply choosing each individual asset you need.

 # Contributing to the Repo
 Let's say you have just created an excellent infographic that you would like to add to the repo and to get Community approval. If you are already familiar with Git commands you can always contribute through conventional means however, if you are a first-time user and not familiar with the Git VCS commands you have the option of using Github Desktop (GUI).
 
To start, you will need to do the following first:

 1. [Register for  Github account.](https://github.com/join)
2.  Download and install [Github Desktop.](https://desktop.github.com/)

The next part will involve cloning the repo. 

 1. Open Github Desktop fter you have installed it and in the **File** menu, click **Clone Repository**.

2.  Click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone. The easiest way is to click  **URL**  and manually enter the repository location.

3.  Click  **Choose...**  and navigate to a local path where you want to clone the repository.
4. Click **Clone**.

Now you have a copy of the repo locally on your computer. A few things to note are two buttons: 

 - **Fetch Origin** this is to sync your local copy with the most up-to-date
 - **Commit to Main** this is to send any additions you have made to the main repo for approval

Let's walkthrough an example to illustrate the process of adding an asset. So let's say I want to add a simple change to this Readme file, one word. I would make the changes to the cloned local copy, goto Github Desktop and click on the repo

You’ll see the file or files you edited in the ‘Changes’ tab on the left. Clicking a file will typically show you what got changed. The red line indicates something was removed, while the green means something was added.

Now, you want to send the changes for review. To do so, you first have to ‘commit’ the change internally. Go to the bottom left and write a title for your update, followed by an optional (recommended) description. Click the blue Commit to Main button, and a spinning icon will whirl around. This will ONLY commit the changes to your pc. Next, you have to ‘push’ the build to Github itself.

To do so, you will need to make a Pull Request. First goto Branch under Github Desktop's menu and click **Create pull request** this will take you to a webpage where you can send the pull request to the orgin repo for review and acceptance. 

Once there all you do is make sure the repositories at the top show an arrow going FROM yours TO the orgin one. Then at that point just click the green **MAKE PULL REQUEST** button, then submit it, and you’re done. 

Congratulations, you’ve become a contributor!
